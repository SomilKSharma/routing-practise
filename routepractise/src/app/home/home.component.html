        There are various types of routing mechanisms, including client-side routing and server-side routing. Each type
        has its advantages and use cases, depending on the requirements of your web application. Client-side routing,
        as implemented in JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, allows for dynamic content loading
        without full page reloads. On the other hand, server-side routing involves the server handling requests and
        returning the appropriate HTML page. This traditional approach is widely used in many web applications and
